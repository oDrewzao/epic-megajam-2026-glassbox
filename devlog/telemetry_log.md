# Glass Box Telemetry Log - 2026 Epic AI MegaJam

- **Project:** `epic-megajam-2026-glassbox`
- **Official Theme:** DIRECTOR'S CUT
- **Platform:** UEFN (Unreal Editor for Fortnite / Verse / Creative 2.0)
- **Version:** `0.2.0`
- **Image Hosting Base URL (Raw):** `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oDrewzao/epic-megajam-2026-glassbox/main/devlog/images/`
- **Image Hosting Base URL (jsDelivr CDN):** `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/oDrewzao/epic-megajam-2026-glassbox@main/devlog/images/`
- **Image Pipeline Rule:** Every incoming screenshot, sketch, or diagram dropped into chat or assets is copied to `devlog/images/` using sequential normalized filenames (`fig01_theme_concept.png`, `fig02_level_sketch.png`, etc.) and immediately staged with `git add`.

### [2026-11-11T22:22:15Z] - [INFRASTRUCTURE] - Initialize Glass Box Telemetry & GitHub Image Hosting Architecture
- **Environment & Exact Model:** Antigravity / Gemini 3.8 Flash
- **Subsystem:** Asset Pipeline / Devlog Telemetry / Multi-Agent Governance
- **Design Rationale (Director's Intent):** Establishes transparent, auditable "Glass Box" development logging and reliable public CDN image resolution for the 2026 Epic AI MegaJam ("DIRECTOR'S CUT"). Unifies rules across Antigravity, Cursor, Claude, and generic agent tooling so every decision, prompt, scope cut, and failure mode is captured consistently in English without exposing private UEFN or API credentials.
- **Prompt Used (Translated to English):** `Initialize the automated Glass Box telemetry and GitHub-backed image hosting architecture for our UEFN project participating in the 2026 Epic AI MegaJam (Theme: "DIRECTOR'S CUT"). Set up Git and public GitHub image serving (epic-megajam-2026-glassbox), create devlog/images/, devlog/game_design_context.md, devlog/telemetry_log.md, and multi-agent protocol files (.antigravityrules, .cursorrules, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md), and log this initial entry.`
- **Execution & Code/Assets:**
  - Created hardened `.gitignore` covering secrets (`.env*`, keys, certificates, credentials), dependencies, build caches, OS files, and UEFN local generated directories (`Intermediate/`, `Saved/`, `DerivedDataCache/`, `Binaries/`, `.urc/`).
  - Initialized local Git repository on branch `main`.
  - Created `devlog/images/` (tracked via `.gitkeep`).
  - Created `devlog/game_design_context.md` with the Living GDD structure for theme "DIRECTOR'S CUT".
  - Created `devlog/telemetry_log.md` with the initial header and this first telemetry entry.
  - Created `.antigravityrules`, `.cursorrules`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md` enforcing language, redaction, image auto-linking (`oDrewzao/epic-megajam-2026-glassbox`), and telemetry schema rules.
- **AI Hallucinations, Verse Errors & Human Debugging (GLASS BOX TRANSPARENCY):**
  - No AI hallucinations or Verse compilation errors occurred (UEFN Verse code has not been authored yet).
  - *Governance & Tooling Note:* The prompt included the unresolved placeholder `[SEU_USUARIO_GITHUB]`; inspected local `gh auth status` to resolve the authenticated GitHub handle as `oDrewzao`. Per workspace Git security rules, remote public repository creation (`--public`) and initial `git commit` / `git push` were held for explicit human confirmation, then authorized and executed cleanly (`v0.1.0`).

### [2026-11-12T02:51:51Z] - [DESIGN] - Ingest Initial Pre-Kickoff GDD Specification (Director's Cut Roguelike)
- **Environment & Exact Model:** Antigravity / Gemini 3.8 Flash
- **Subsystem:** Game Design Document / System Architecture / Scope Planning
- **Design Rationale (Director's Intent):** Translates the creator's 6-page pre-kickoff engineering specification (`GDD SPEC-2026`) into the repository's living GDD before the jam start window opens. Establishes a focused, shippable roguelite loop built around the *Director's Cut* theme—turning film-editing verbs (*Cut!*, *Freeze Frame*, *Rewind*, *Fast-Forward*, *Plot Armor*) into core combat/traversal actions while preserving NavMesh stability via a fixed-stage constellation architecture and explicit scope flexibility.
- **Prompt Used (Translated to English):** `Here is the initial development plan to start development as soon as the kickoff time is permitted! Despite the level of detail, it will be subject to changes throughout development. [Attached 6-page Engineering Specification PDF: DIRECTOR'S CUT ROGUELIKE]`
- **Execution & Code/Assets:**
  - Parsed the 6-page `DIRECTOR'S CUT ROGUELIKE` specification (`GDD SPEC-2026`).
  - Updated `devlog/game_design_context.md` with the full living GDD: strategic award matrix (`Best Overall UEFN`, `Walkie-Talkie`, `Glass Box`, `Solo Driver`), 5-step Take Progression Cycle, the 5 `Director's Remote` abilities and Roll costs, NPC Director **Stanley** persona specs, fixed-stage constellation set classes, 35mm Film Strip Drafting meta-progression, 4 decoupled Verse/UMG system modules, pre-kickoff procedural generation scope cut, and the 4-phase technical roadmap.
  - Bumped repository version tracking to `0.2.0` in `devlog/telemetry_log.md`.
- **AI Hallucinations, Verse Errors & Human Debugging (GLASS BOX TRANSPARENCY):**
  - No Verse code generated yet; awaiting official jam start time to begin Phase 1 UEFN implementation.
  - *Proactive Technical Risk Flagged for Phase 1–2:* Marked two UEFN implementation assumptions in the spec for early verification at kickoff: (1) confirming the exact UEFN native `Conversation Device` + runtime LLM NPC integration mechanics for the Walkie-Talkie Modifier, and (2) ensuring `Film Strip UI Controller` leverages UMG / Verse UI Kit patterns cleanly within UEFN sandbox constraints.
  - *Asset Pipeline Note:* Kept the multi-page PDF spec synthesized directly in Markdown rather than committing raw PDF binaries or page renders into `devlog/images/`, avoiding repository bloat and preserving `devlog/images/` for actual concept art, architecture diagrams, and UEFN editor/gameplay captures.
